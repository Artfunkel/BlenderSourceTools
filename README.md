# BlenderSourceTools
The Blender Source Tools add Source engine support to Blender, the free 3D modelling suite made by Artfunkel.
This branch is mainly made for AGR (Advancedfx Game Recording) users.

## What is different?

There won't be any collections after the import for less messy AGR project files.
The removing of collections can give you problems if you work with .dmx files, so if you are planning to use such files please download the original version of Blender Source Tools.

## How to install

1. Install Blender 2.8x.
2. Download Blender Source Tools on the [Release page](https://github.com/Devostated/BlenderSourceTools/releases/).
2.1 Do NOT unzip it.

In Blender:
1. Select Edit > User Preferences
2. Move to the Addons tab
3. Click Install... at the top of the window
3.1 Find the downloaded zip file
4. Find and check the Source Tools box.
